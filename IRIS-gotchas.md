# IRIS Gotchas.

We will update this file with the lastest list of issues we have encountered when installing IRIS, which is a dependancy for this project.

## Installing Ninja on OSX

### 1. **Homebrew**

```sh
brew install ninja
```

This installs Ninja and puts it in your PATH.

### 2. Macports

```sh
sudo port install ninja 
```

### 3. **Manual download**

* Go to the [Ninja GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases).
* Download the macOS binary (`ninja-mac.zip`).
* Unzip and move the `ninja` executable into `/usr/local/bin` (or somewhere in your PATH).

---

### How to Check if Ninja is Installed

Open **Terminal** and run:

```sh
ninja --version
```

* If installed, youâ€™ll see something like:

  ```
  1.12.1
  ```
* If not installed, youâ€™ll see an error such as:

  ```
  zsh: command not found: ninja
  ```

## I am having trouble installing IRIS

### cURL errors on OSX using Macports

Some users, when trying to build IRIS via `cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLE_APP=ON --preset macos-release`, may get the following errors:

```
Trying https://sourceforge.net/projects/giflib/files///giflib-5.2.2.tar.gz/download?use_mirror=tenet 
error: curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

The `curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate` error could means your curl/vcpkg canâ€™t find a trusted CA bundle when hitting SourceForge. 


Using macports, you'll need to use `curl-ca-bundle` or `openssl` packages instead of Homebrewâ€™s `ca-certificates`.


#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1. Install CA certificates via MacPorts

```sh
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install curl-ca-bundle
```

That installs a system CA bundle, usually at:

```
/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
```

You can verify:

```sh
ls -l /opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2. Point your tools to the bundle

Set these environment variables before running `cmake`:

```sh
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
```

That tells `curl` (and thus vcpkg) where to find the CA roots.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3. Retry vcpkg

Go back into your IRIS directory and re-run:

```sh
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLE_APP=ON --preset macos-release
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4. (Optional) Make it permanent

If you donâ€™t want to set env vars every time, add the lines to your shell config:

* For Zsh:

```sh
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
export GIT_SSL_CAINFO=/opt/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem
```


#### Step 5: Test

Run:

```
curl -I https://github.com
```

If this fix works, you should read output like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:52:59 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

.... more data ...

```

If it doesn't, you'll probably read something like this:

```
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate in certificate chain More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and how to fix it, please visit the webpage mentioned above.
```


If the latter is the case, then switch to `certsync` (this is especially recommended on corp networks)

1. Deactivate the conflicting bundle:

```bash
sudo port -f deactivate curl-ca-bundle
```

2. Install and run certsync:

```bash
sudo port install certsync
sudo certsync
# writes: /opt/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem
```


3. Re-Test:

```bash
/opt/local/bin/curl -I https://github.com
```

> If that works, add those `export` lines to your `~/.zshrc`.

You can keep `curl-ca-bundle` **deactivated**. If you ever re-activate it, it will conflict with `certsync` again.
