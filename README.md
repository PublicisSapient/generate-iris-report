+ Generate Iris Report

This application is to be used in conjunction with [IRIS](https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS) to generate a report that tells auditors if videos comply with  [WCAG 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A) ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html).  

It currently generates a report, similar to the one generated by [PEAT](https://trace.umd.edu/photosensitive-epilepsy-analysis-tool-peat-user-guide/) to tell non-technical users where there are issues with the video they are testing in a nice tabular format.  This report currently is rendered as a tagged PDF using [openHTMLtoPDF](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf) so that it can be read by screen reader users.
