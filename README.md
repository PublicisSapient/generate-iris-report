# Generate Iris Report

This application is to be used in conjunction with [IRIS](https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS) to generate a report that identifies video footage that could potentially cause photosensitive epileptic risks. The IRIS report states that it is not intended to guarantee, certify or otherwise validate visual content's compliance with legal, regulatory or other requirements, so the same applies with this report as well.

This project currently generates a report, similar to the one generated by [PEAT](https://trace.umd.edu/photosensitive-epilepsy-analysis-tool-peat-user-guide/) to tell non-technical users where there are issues with the video they are testing in a nice tabular format.  This report currently is rendered as a tagged PDF using [openHTMLtoPDF](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf) so that it can be read by screen reader users.

## How to install:

Currently, you should be comfortable with compiling and building code to use this tool.  In future, we hope to include an install program so non-technical users will be able to install this without any programming knowledge.

1. Install Java from [the Oracle Java Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) You must use Java 8 or higher.
1. Install Maven from [the Apache Maven Download page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). You must use Maven 3.9.9 or higher.
1. Install both IRIS and generate-iris-report in the same directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:electronicarts/IRIS.git
git clone git@github.com:PublicisSapient/generate-iris-report.git
```

1. Go into the IRIS directory and install IRIS according to the instructions in [the IRIS README.md file](https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS).  If you are having difficulty building IRIS, please read our [IRIS-gotchas.md](./IRIS-gotchas.md) file.
1. Go into the `generate-iris-report` directory and run `mvn install`.  This will install and build the `generate-iris-report` Java code.
1. If you have done all of the above, you should be able to run the `generate-iris-report` application (see below):

## Running a Report

If you are running Linux or Mac OSX, you should be 

```
./generate-iris-report.sh _input-video_ _output-pdf_
```

You can run this command without any arguments.  It will prompt you for the values it needs to run a report.

If you prefer a GUI, you can use:

```
./generate-iris-report-gui.sh
```
